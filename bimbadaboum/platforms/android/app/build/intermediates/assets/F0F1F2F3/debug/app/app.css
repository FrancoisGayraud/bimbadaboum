/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/
.oldFashion {
	font-family: "OldStandard-Regular";
}

.body {
    -webkit-background-size: cover;
    -moz-background-size: cover;
    -o-background-size: cover;
    background-size: cover;
    background-color: #FFF8DC;
}

.Button {
	color: white;
	font-size:12;
	background-color: #b090FF;
	width: 50%;
	margin-top: 10vh;
	margin-bottom: 50vh;

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
